# Instagram_Analysis

### Description

This project aims to analyze Instagram data and predict impressions using RandomForestRegressor, a machine learning algorithm. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, we aim to forecast impressions for future Instagram posts.

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

      pip install pandas scikit-learn
### Usage

Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/sggsfhydhughjhf/Instagram_Analysis.git
      cd instagram_Analysis

      
Prepare your Instagram data (see Data Preparation).
Train the model (see Training the Model).
Make predictions (see Prediction).
### Data Preparation

Prepare your Instagram data in a CSV format with columns like 'likes,' 'comments,' 'followers,' etc. Ensure the data is cleaned and preprocessed before use.

Example CSV format:
      [likes,comments,followers,impressions
      100,10,1000,1500
      200,15,1200,1800
      ...
      Training the Model]
Run the train_model.py script to train the RandomForestRegressor model:
      python train_model.py
This script will load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and save the trained model for future predictions.

### Prediction

Use the trained model to make predictions by running the predict.py script:

      python predict.py
The script will prompt you to enter values for 'likes,' 'comments,' and 'followers' for the post you want to predict impressions for.
